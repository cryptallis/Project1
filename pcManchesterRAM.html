	<p style="font-size:25px; font-family:sans-serif, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:black; margin: 5%"<p>We know that the CPU needs to interact with the main memory, or RAM, in order to carry out its function. But what is RAM? The opposite to RAM is SAM, which stands for serial access memory. The data is SAM is stored in a series of memory cells which can only be accessed sequentially much like a cassette tape. If the data is not found within the current location, then every memory cell is checked until the required data is found. RAM is called random access memory because any memory cell can be accessed directly as long ass the the row and column that intersect that cell is known.</p>

<img style= "margin-left: 5%"; src= "RAM1.PNG" align="left"/><p style="font-size:25px; font-family:sans-serif, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:black; margin: 5%"<p>RAM consists of millions of capacitors and transistors. A memory cell is created where a transistor and capacitor are paired and this represents 1 bit of data which will be either a 0 or a 1. The bit is stored in the capacitor and the transistor acts as a switch, allowing the value to be either read or changed. A capacitor can be visualized as a bucket with a leak, in order to store a 1 in the memory cell it is filled with electrons and to store a 0 the bucket is emptied. The “leak” is because a capacitor can only hold the electrons for milliseconds and to keep the bit at a value of 1, the CPU has to recharge the capacitor. It does this by reading the memory controller and then re-writing the value, this refresh process occurs thousands of time per second. This refreshing is also where the D in DRAM (which stands for dynamic) comes from, as the DRAM must be dynamically refreshed before it forgets what it’s holding.</p>
