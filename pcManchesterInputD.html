Input devices are used to provide information and data to the computer. The most common input devices would be the mouse and keyboard, but there are dozens of other daily used hardware devices that are input devices such as:<ul><li style="font-size:25px; font-family:sans-serif, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:black;"<li>Barcode Reader</li><li style="font-size:25px; font-family:sans-serif, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:black;"<li>Digital Camera</li><li style="font-size:25px; font-family:sans-serif, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:black;"<li>Joystick</li><li style="font-size:25px; font-family:sans-serif, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:black;"<li>Graphics Tablet</li><li style="font-size:25px; font-family:sans-serif, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:black;"<li>Microphone</li><li style="font-size:25px; font-family:sans-serif, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:black;"<li>Webcam and many more</li></ul> 
	
	<p style="font-size:25px; font-family:sans-serif, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:black; margin: 5%"<p>Keyboards contain a processor and circuitry that carries information to and from this processor. There is a grid circuitry, which is known as the key matrix, that sits under each key on the keyboard. Each circuit is broken below every key which acts as a switch, when a key is pressed the circuit is complete allowing a current to flow through. The processor within the keyboard locates closed circuits and compares the location of the circuit  on the key matrix to the character map within the read-only memory, or ROM. The character map is basically a lookup table which tells the processor the position of each key in the matrix, and what each keystroke or key combinations represents. An example would be pressing the “t” key by itself would represent the small character t, whereas pressing Shift and t represents the capital letter “T”. This character map can be overwritten using software which can be useful if the user wanted to type in another language using an English keyboard. Keyboards can be either wired or wireless, with the wireless option requiring a receiver to be plugged into the computer and the wired option is typically plugged in via a USB connection.</p>

	<p style="font-size:25px; font-family:sans-serif, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:black; margin: 5%"<p>Both wired and wireless keyboards function in the same way, with the signal from the keyboard being monitored by the computer’s keyboard controller. The keyboard controller processes the input data and forwards it to the operating system or OS. When the OS receives the data it checks to see if the data represents a system level command, for example Ctrl-Alt-Delete. If the input data is not a system level command, the OS sends the data to the currently used application. The application will determine if the data is a command, for example Ctrl-s which would save a word document. Finally, if the data is not a command then the application accepts it as content. If the application decides the data is not content as this stage, the keyboard data is ignored. This entire process takes mere milliseconds.</p>
